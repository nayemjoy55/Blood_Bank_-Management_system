# Blood_Bank_Management_system 
## Applying sdlc model: 
  - For a Blood Bank Management System project, considering the nature of the application and potential changes in requirements, a more flexible and iterative SDLC model could be beneficial. Here's the suitable option that is incremental model:
    ### Incremental model :
      - The incremental model is an iterative approach to software development. Here are the steps for developing a Blood Bank Management System using the incremental model:
      - Requirement Analysis: Identify and gather requirements for the Blood Bank Management System.Prioritize requirements based on their importance and criticality.
      - System Design:Create a high-level design of the entire system.Break down the design into smaller, manageable modules.
      - Implementation (First Increment):Develop and implement the core functionality of the system.Focus on creating a basic version that covers essential features.
      - Testing (First Increment):Perform testing on the implemented features to ensure functionality and identify any issues.
      - Deployment (First Increment):Deploy the initial version of the Blood Bank Management System for users to access and provide feedback.
      - Testing (Subsequent Increments):Conduct testing for each increment to ensure new features integrate smoothly and identify any issues.
      - Final Testing and Deployment:Conduct thorough testing on the final version to ensure all features work seamlessly together.Deploy the complete Blood Bank Management System for widespread use.
